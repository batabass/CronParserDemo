#Cron parser demo

#Cron Parser Demo is a Java-based application designed to parse cron expressions and output the individual components such as minute, hour, day of the month, etc.

#We only consider the standard cron format with five time fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week) plus a command. The input will be on a single line. The cron string is passed as a single argument to the application.

~$ your-program "*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find"

#Limitations

This does not handle the special time strings such as "@yearly"
This Does not handle the ABBREV based Month and Weekday Names. Does not handle operators lile '?' and 'L'


#Instructions to run the program

-Navigate to the project Folder.
- Run Command : ./parser.sh "command"
    eg: ./parser.sh "*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find"
    
    Yields the following output:

minute        0 15 30 45
hour          0
day of month  1 15
month         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
day of week   1 2 3 4 5
command       /usr/bin/find

- The bash Script does the following
    - Install dependencies (mvn clean install)
    - Compiles the project (mvn compile)
    - Calls the main Parser class with the required command

#Tests
